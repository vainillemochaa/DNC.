# Regarding Skin Copying – Pony Town (DNC Notice)

Hi **ScaraLiao**,  
This is a respectful but direct message about your Pony Town skin.

Your bio says:

> "Strictly DNC (Do Not Copy) my cosplays unless I have perms."

I agree — I also strictly DNC my cosplays.  
However, I’ve noticed you copied my skin on Pony Town:

- Same palette  
- Same accessories  
- Same hat  
- Only a minor hairstyle change

You even claimed to have created it in 2024, but your account was made on **April 15, 2025** (you used `/accountdate` yourself).

I have proof that my design is original — including:

- Older versions of my pony  
- A side color you missed (you made both sides the same)  
- Original creation dates  

Please delete the skin.  
I’m asking respectfully and directly: **do not copy or base anything on my design**.  
My Pony Town profile clearly says: **Strictly DNC**.

If you ask others not to copy your work, please follow the same standard.

Thanks for understanding.
